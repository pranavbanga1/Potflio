Abstract
This report details the design and development of an autonomous delivery robot capable of
navigating diverse terrains and performing package delivery tasks within an office setting. The
robot is engineered to autonomously transport, stack, and retrieve packages while effectively
avoiding obstacles and addressing environmental challenges. The project incorporates a variety
of sensors, such as infrared (IR) and ultrasonic sensors, to facilitate obstacle detection and terrain
navigation. The robot is powered by N20 motors, managed by a Cytron 2A motor driver,
allowing for real-time speed regulation and motor control. Furthermore, servo motors are utilized
for package handling, including mechanisms for lifting and releasing.
Phase B of the project emphasizes autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance, wherein the
robot successfully delivers a package to a specified location. The control system is based on the
Arduino Due platform and utilizes the Shield 2A Motor library for motor management, with
encoder feedback ensuring precise movement control. A significant aspect of the system is its
ability to adapt to dynamic environments, which is made possible through the integration of
sensors that enable the robot to modify its path autonomously.
This project exemplifies the effective integration of mechanical design, embedded systems, and
control algorithms to develop a functional prototype for autonomous delivery applications,
underscoring the potential for automation in office logistics.

Introduction
The Mechatronics Design project aims to develop a mechatronics system that can complete
real-world tasks. The mechatronics system in question is an autonomous delivery robot that can
navigate a variety of terrains, as well as fetch, convey, and dispatch packages. The objective for
the semester is for the delivery robot to navigate and transport packages inside a
purpose-designed two-story cardboard building. This main objective is split into three phases:
Phases A, B, and C.
For phase B of the project, the autonomous robot must start from the lobby of the building,
located on the second floor, and navigate to the lower floor via the ramp, to identify the box
within the maze on the lower floor. After picking up the box, the robot is to return to the upper
floor lobby. The terrain for this phase alternated between plywood on the ramp and glass within
the maze, adding complexity to the design process. The second phase ends as soon as the robot
returns to the upper lobby, package in hand. The phase is deemed successful irrespective of
whether the package is dropped or not. The block’s weight and maximum dimensions were
given.

Requirements
The standards to be met for the delivery robot could be divided into physical and functional
requirements. The physical requirements are the conditions and constraints related to physics,
materials, or design the robot needs to achieve to allow it to traverse within the building. The
functional requirements refer to the conditions and constraints related to the behavior, features,
and capabilities within the robot that allow it to achieve its intended purpose. The requirements
are referenced with the prefix P or F (such as P1 for the first physical requirement, and F1 for the
first functional requirement, respectively), throughout the document as necessary. Additionally,
some luxury requirements can be installed on the robot to inculcate cutting-edge technology,
premium materials, and user-centric features on the robot.

7
Physical Requirements:
1.​ Space Constraints: The robot must be able to fit within the dimensions of the lobby
entrance on the second floor, and more importantly, the maze corridor on the first floor.
Additionally, openings or vents will need to be designed to prevent overheating,
particularly when running multiple sensors and motor drivers that generate heat during
extended use.
2.​ Weight Constraints: The robot must be of appropriate weight such that it provides
enough traction to maneuver difficult terrain, but also not be too heavy that the drive
motors are not able to provide thrust to the robot.
3.​ Material Constraints: The materials must be fabricated from robust, lightweight
materials that can safely carry the payload and components, and withstand accidental
contact without fracture.
4.​ Low Center of Gravity: The robot should be designed to arrange components in such a
way as to avoid tipping the robot during functioning. This is necessary as there are
several inclines and tight turns between the floors and in the maze.
5.​ Motion Constraints: The robot's movement must be regulated by a controller to ensure
accuracy. Additionally, the fetching and dispatching of packages must be constrained
with proper motion control.
Functional Requirements:
1.​ Navigation: The robot must be able to navigate its environment thoroughly, without any
external intervention. This must include obstacle detection and a reasonable amount of
mapping capabilities. This should be achieved using sensors to gather data of the
surroundings.
2.​ Payload Delivery: The robot must be able to securely load, carry, and unload the
prescribed payload of 0.25 kg.
3.​ Power and Energy Management: The robot must have a power supply capacity to
conduct all of its functions, and the ability to recharge its battery when low.
4.​ Safety: The robot must have a safety mechanism such as a manual override button to
stop functioning. The robot must also be able to function without causing damage or
harm to its environment.

8
5.​ Manufacturability: The robot must be scalable for manufacturability. Importance should
be given to ease of maintenance, customizability, and design modularity.
Luxury Requirements:
1.​ High-Grade Materials: Use materials like carbon fiber, anodized aluminum, or brushed
stainless steel to provide a classy, durable exterior.
2.​ AI-Powered Navigation: Equipped with AI and machine learning algorithms for
seamless navigation in complex environments.
3.​ Smartphone Integration: A luxury feature to customize delivery preferences via a
dedicated app, track deliveries in real-time, or communicate with the robot.
4.​ Advanced Security System: Incorporate biometric security for access to the payload in
the robot’s storage compartment.
These are just a few features that could be implemented after creating early prototypes to provide
an exceptional experience for customers about functionality, security, and aesthetics.

Background
To comprehend the team's design, a thorough understanding of the history of delivery robots and
the team's utilized solutions is crucial.
Delivery robots are gaining relevance with the advent of autonomous vehicle technology. These
robots deal with the issue of last-mile logistics, as they are used to significantly reduce delivery
time, costs, and emissions. Delivery robots first emerged in the early 2000s, with companies like
Kiva Systems relying on automation for warehouse storage and retrieval [1]. The automation
industry did not find much evolution till technology companies like Google and Tesla delved into
the concept of autonomous vehicles, which in turn developed smaller, localized robots. In 2014,
two startup companies named Starship Technologies and Nuro continued growth in the sector.
Starship Technologies aimed to deploy compact robots for short-distance neighborhood
deliveries in a mission to reduce costs and emissions, whereas Nuro focussed on Level 4
autonomous robots that could travel on roads without the need for a human driver. An accelerator
to the adoption of automated delivery systems was the COVID-19 pandemic, as contactless

9
distribution became the norm. These systems naturally entailed a new skilled job requirement for
robot operation, maintenance, and software development. In the wake of fresh developments in
the field of robotics, the assignment to create delivery robots is extremely pertinent [2].
The team robot’s framework was inspired by the chassis style of the Panzerhaubitze 2000 (PzH
2000). This tank claims a multi-level chassis, the second level being drawn back from the first.
The PzH was developed in 1995 by German defense companies KMW and Rheinmetall for the
German Army, where the chassis components were derived from the Leopard 2 tank. This
development was driven by the obsolescence of the earlier PzH 155-1 program, which had
several design defects and reliability issues. The tank boasted a chassis built on armored steel,
along with the passive roof-liner enabling a protection level previously unknown [3].
Continuous tracks or tracked treads used in the team's design are similar to the tracks on a
bulldozer or tank. These tracks on the team's system run on a gear cog and a wheel, while
conventional tracks run on track plates. The modern form of tracked treads was invented and
patented by Benjamin Holt in 1904, to aid agriculture in areas of soft soil, where typical rubber
wheels would sink. These tracks were christened Caterpillar, and commercialized by the Holt
Manufacturing Company, owned by the patent proprietor. The tracks found their use in military
operations during the First World War in later years [4]. The advantages of the tracks were
several, including ●​

Weight distribution across the track plates, allows it to maneuver on rough terrain.

●​

Provide better traction for handling large loads.

●​

Structural strength that delivered resistance to wear and tear.

However, there are some disadvantages to be considered, such as ●​

Lesser maximum speed.

●​

Environmental damage caused by the track surface.

●​

Greater power usage.

●​

The loss of a single track segment renders the system inoperable.

These were the considerations while choosing this form of transportation.

10
The claw design the team implemented in the project was inspired by the claw arcade machine,
which can move the claw in all three axes and pick up objects by actuating the claws. These claw
machines date back to the 1890s when they were built to resemble machinery to construct the
Panama Canal in North America. They first emerged as arcade games when the Erie Digger was
introduced. This had a coin-operated steam shovel that moved in an arc operated by a handle and
could pick up small objects like candy. William Bartlett was able to patent (US patent 1,882,563)
a design improvement by supplying power through an electric motor and giving the claw
complete access within a box [5]. These machines gained fame as arcade games during the 1990s,
during the economic crisis in Japan and South Korea when pressured youth struggled to find
employment [6]. Many pros make the claw design viable, such as ●​

Versatility in picking up various objects.

●​

Superior grip strength by being able to apply pressure on the load. This allows it to carry
heavier objects with no issue.

●​

Precision and control when handling objects.

●​

The claw design requires less maintenance compared to manual or pneumatic systems.

The disadvantage of the claw system must also be considered. This being ●​

Difficulty in holding fragile objects, as the pressure from the claws may cause it to break.

●​

Limited surface contact which could lead to dropping the load if insecure.

●​

Requiring a consistent supply of power for applying pressure on the object.

These points were considered and the team's design was adapted to accommodate the cons of the
design.

11

Design Plan and Project Management
The structure and organization of the project were maintained using Miro, which served as a
collaborative tool for planning, brainstorming, and tracking progress. Miro allowed the team to
visualize project phases, assign tasks, and document key decisions, ensuring that everyone was
aligned on the timeline and objectives.

The Gantt chart provides a structured timeline for the autonomous delivery robot project, broken
down into three key phases: Research and Resourcing, Phase A and B Development, and
additionally, phase C and Testing. Starting with brainstorming, concept sketching, and
component sourcing, the project lays a strong foundation by ensuring all necessary resources are
identified and acquired.
During the development phases, the team focused on printing the chassis, establishing motor
control, and developing initial navigation capabilities for Phase A requirements. By October’s
end, the team will achieve a functional Proof of Concept (POC) that addresses basic delivery
tasks using sensor integration and coding, building the core functionality required for
autonomous movement. The final phase emphasizes refining algorithms, enhancing sensor
efficiency, and performing comprehensive testing to optimize the robot’s performance. The
project culminates with final adjustments and an assessment of the Minimum Viable Product
(MVP) to ensure it meets all requirements for successful demonstration.

12

Brainstorming and Concept Generation
The team began the team's concept design by researching the optimal materials and technologies
that could be implemented in the system. The team broke the robot's functionalities into several
key aspects and then explored each feature to yield a vast number of options that could be
implemented on the robot. During this phase, it is important to remember that the team only
focused on gathering as many alternatives for each feature as possible. Once all courses of action
were surveyed, the subsequent steps would aim to narrow down the options to champion the
optimal solutions for the project.

Power Supply
The team started with the problem of powering the robot. This was the first thing to consider as it
is the integral component that provides the mandated energy to operate all system components.
The power supply must be chosen based on the current and voltage requirements of the system to
ensure stable operation and prevent damage to the electronic components (F3). Since the team's
robot was a mobile robot that would not be stationary, it would have to implement a rechargeable
energy-dense battery design, for which the team was able to find three variants: Lithium-Ion
(Li-ion), Lithium-Polymer (LiPo), and Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH).
●​

Li-ion batteries are high-energy density batteries made up of a lithium-based cathode and
graphite-based anode. These are lightweight and provide 800 life cycles of consistent use.

●​

LiPo batteries are similar to Li-ion batteries, but instead of a liquid, they use a polymer
electrolyte. This makes the batteries flexible, making them moldable to any shape or size.
These batteries are also extremely lightweight and provide a decent 600 life cycle.

Both Li-ion and LiPo batteries provide a similar nominal voltage of 3.7V per cell and have a
slow discharge rate.
●​

NiMH batteries use a nickel oxide cathode and a hydrogen-absorbing anode. These
batteries are heavier and less energy-dense, providing lesser voltage (1.2V per cell) in
comparison to Lithium batteries, but have a higher number of life cycles (2000 life
cycles) and are regarded as safer batteries under duress. NiMH also has a higher
self-discharge when not in use.

13
These were the essential trade-offs to consider when deliberating on the power supply of the
robot.

Robot Actuation
The team’s next focus was on robot actuation, as that was pivotal to the success of phase B of the
project. This problem required taking note of motor specifications since they would decide the
maximum output torque. Based on these factors, the maximum weight of the robot would also be
determined, so that the robot does not struggle in adverse terrain (F1). The team began by
exploring all motors that would fit the requirements.
●​

Small geared DC motors give high torque at lower speeds via its built-in gear reduction
system. An example of a small-geared DC motor is the N20.

●​

Brushed DC Motors provide high speed and low torque, and are typically smaller and
more compact as compared to small geared DC motors. The speed and direction are
controlled via pulse-width modulation (PWM) and a motor driver. An example of a
brushed DC motor would be the 130 DC motor.

●​

Brushless DC Motors, instead of brushed DC motors, use electronic commutation rather
than physical brushes to achieve motion. These motors require an electronic speed
controller (ESC) for operation controlled by a PWM. An example of the BLDC motor
would be the 2212 1000 KV Brushless Motor.

●​

Stepper Motors would rotate in precise steps, offering control of the rotation and
position of the propelling system without needing feedback sensors. The precise control
is owed to the step pulses sent by the microcontroller that moves the motor in discrete
increments. An example of a stepper motor would be the 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor.

●​

Continuous Rotation Servo Motors is a variation of servo motors modified for 360°
rotation, thereby being a suitable motor for actuation. PWM signals set the speed and
direction of the motor, but the precise speed adjustment applicable to regular servo
motors applies to this motor. An example of a continuous rotation servo motor would be
the FS90R Continuous Rotation Servo.

These were the team's options, taking into consideration the weight and size of the robot, and
terrain factors.

14

Sensing Mechanisms
Sensors will be the primary method with which the team obtains feedback on the positioning and
orientation of the robot. This detail underlines the importance of implementing sensors with
precision. Sensors will also mandate the use of an appropriate control logic to navigate the maze
for phase B. Many sensors that could find purpose in the project arose during the team's research,
namely ●​

Ultrasonic Sensors use sound waves to detect objects and subsequently measure
distances. The sensor sends a pulse wave and then calculates the distance to the nearest
object by recording the time taken for the pulse wave to return. An example of an
ultrasonic sensor would be the HC-SR04.

●​

Infrared Sensors detect objects using reflected infrared light. IR sensors excel in
detecting nearby objects, while some IR sensors, like the Sharp sensor, can also measure
distance similar to the Ultrasonic Sensor. An example of an IR sensor would be the
TCRT5000.

●​

LIDAR Sensors use laser beams to scan the environment and create a map of obstacles
in the vicinity. This assists in navigating complex spaces. An example of the LIDAR
sensor would be YDLIDAR X4.

●​

Proximity sensors also work similarly to distance sensors, by measuring the distance
using time-of-flight technology. This allows the robot to detect walls or objects in narrow
spaces. An example of this would be the VL53L0X TOF sensor.

●​

Wheel encoders are a type of sensor that can directly track the rotation of the wheels to
measure the distance traveled. This assists with navigating mapped paths and providing
accurate speed control. Wheel encoders are provided as a feature with many motors in
use in the Arduino environment.

Terrain Navigating Movement Mechanisms
For navigation, the movement mechanisms would have to be tailored to the motor, ensuring a
tight fit with no slip. During research, the team was able to identify three different movement
mechanisms: wheels, a propeller, and a chain drive system.
●​

The wheel and propeller would function similarly, but the wheel would have a rubberized
grip and treads for increased traction. The outer ring would be connected to the inner hub

15
utilizing spokes for structural integrity.
●​

The propeller would have curved blades making contact with the terrain. The curved
blade would be connected to the propeller via the propeller hub. The curved blades must
have a large surface area that can make contact with the ground to enable movement.

●​

The chain drive system, on the other hand, would actuate similarly to a tank locomotion
system, where the system would latch onto the motor using a gear cog. The chain drive
could be created by fabricating a series of chain links, attached using pins and locking in
place using a lock.

Main Chassis
Next in the process was designing the main chassis. The main criteria the chassis would have to
achieve were the initial constraints of space, weight, and material, outlined in the introduction
(P1, P2, P3). This chassis would also be required to house all of the components and provide
enough space for wiring and motor actuation. The team also strived to provide safety for the
payload in question, therefore requiring a secure position during package transportation. With
these benchmarks to attain, the team brainstormed between two approaches to the team's chassis
design: the vertical and horizontal chassis.
●​

The vertical chassis would be a configuration where all the components would be stacked
up one after another on multi-level housings. These housings would be supported by rigid
pillars on each end of the chassis. The box structure would house each component.

●​ The horizontal chassis would have all the components placed next to each other. The
single-level chassis will have separate partitions printed for modularity and to assemble
the components in specific compartments. Horizontal chassis will also have a lower
center of gravity owing to the single level.
The team’s decision would have to be made based on the placement and configuration of the
components and the space of the building (i.e. the environment).

Package Collection and Delivery Mechanism
The final part to be designed was the mechanism to pick and place the package. The team’s
initial concepts revolved around a claw-like gripper and a shovel to scoop the package up from
its position.

16
●​

A gripper would allow for handling small parts or delicate objects with excellent
precision. The claw would be able to adjust to different objects and geometries by
opening the claw to different configurations. The one downside to the gripper is that it
would allow any object to slip through if not held securely. Additionally, the gripper
would struggle with holding several objects at once.

●​

A shovel mechanism is better suited for picking up bulkier, loose materials. It would also
manage to hold several objects at once, which can be an advantage. The downside to the
shovel is that it cannot handle intricate or fragile objects.

The decision between using the gripper and the shovel would depend on the precision and
accuracy required in picking up and placing the object or the number of objects in question.
Note: For initial multiview sketches of each component on grid paper, please refer to Appendix
A.

Engineering Specifications and Benchmarking
​

House of Quality
The House of Quality matrix is defined based on Quality Function Deployment (QFD)
principles. Quality Function Deployment is a comprehensive quality design system that focuses
on understanding customer requirements and ultimately improving positive qualities that will
add value to the product. The goal of the system is straightforward: it is a useful tool that helps
with converting customer requirements into quantifiable design and engineering specifications.

Customer Requirements
In the case of this project, the customer requirements refer to the outlined requirements in the
relevant subsection, namely ●​

Robot Size Restrictions

●​

Robot Weight Restrictions

●​

Robot Material Strength

●​

Low Center of Gravity

●​

Motion Control and Terrain Adaptability

●​

Navigation & Obstacle Detection

●​

Payload Delivery

●​

Power Management

●​

Safety

●​

Manufacturability

Each requirement has an importance rating (out of 5), which determines how useful the
requirement is to the delivery robot project. As can be seen in the diagram, Payload Delivery and
Robot Size Restriction are ranked highest (5), as they are essential to the successful completion
of the objective. Robot Weight Restriction and Manufacturability, on the other hand, is relatively
less important.

18

Engineering Specifications
The next task is evaluating engineering specifications that can satisfy the customer’s
requirements. This was the most difficult as there are a variety of technical specifications that
can match the requirements. In the end, the team filtered out the most significant ones to
cross-relate with the customer requirements. Each relationship would be given a rank (labeled
importance rating) based on the level of association. These ranks would then be multiplied with
the customer requirement rank from the previous step and an absolute rank for each engineering
specification is then obtained. The engineering specifications in question are ●​

Payload Weight - Relates to the robot characteristics being affected by the weight of the
payload. Since the package size and weight are already given, the robot would have to be
modeled to transport this payload as efficiently as possible. The robot must be optimized
to carry the heaviest payload weight it can handle. The unit for payload weight is
measured in Kilogram (kg).

●​

Battery Capacity - Relates to the size and power output of the battery. The team aims to
have a robot that can achieve a minimum runtime of 60 minutes. For this, a sizable
battery will be needed that can maintain the actuation of the robot, gripper, and activation
of the sensors and Arduino. Battery capacity is measured in mAh.

●​

Ultrasonic/IR Sensor Accuracy - Denotes the accuracy required in the components and
control logic to ensure the robot's ability to navigate, avoid obstacles, and accurately
reach delivery destinations. Ultrasonic accuracy is directly tied to safety as well, as fault
sensors could lead to compromised safety. Sensor accuracy is measured in cm.

●​

Wheel Encoder Resolution - Mentions the encoder resolution accuracy in reading the
RPM of the robot drive motors. This is important because if the encoders fail to read the
revolutions correctly, the robot could misjudge the distance and cause an accident.
Encoder resolution is measured in RPM.

●​

Motor Torque - Motor Torque is crucial in autonomous robots as it determines the
robot's ability to move, maneuver, and handle different terrains. This specification should
be optimized to carry maximum load and traverse steeper inclines. Motor Torque is
measured in Nm.

●​

Motor Speed Control - Motor speed control is vital for the safe, efficient, and reliable
operation of the robot. It allows for precise navigation, adaptability in the face of

19
ever-changing conditions, energy conservation, and ensuring safety, all of which are
essential for continuous successful deliveries. Motor Speed Control is measured in PWM
or duty cycle sent from the microcontroller.
●​

Servo Tilt/Pan Angle - The Servo Tilt and Pan angle are the engineering specifications
related to the operation of the gripper. This is important as the pick and place operation of
the package is integral to the success of the project. The exact angle of the gripper
holding the package for the robot will also determine the latter’s stability. The Servo
Angle is measured in ° (degrees).

●​

Robot Dimensions - Robot dimensions refer to the size and height of the robot itself.
This is crucial for allowing delivery to tight spaces within the maze with obstacles
present. This can also help with optimizing power efficiency, as well as maintaining
stability. Robot dimensions are measured in centimeters.

●​

Robot Stability on Inclines - Robot Stability refers to the foundational requirement for a
robot to prevent tipping or falling. As a consequence, the bot will be more reliable on
different terrain and provide more consistent performance under load variations. The
robot will also be able to face steeper inclines with higher confidence. Stability on
inclines is determined using ° (degrees).

●​

Chassis Material Tensile Strength - This metric determines the durability and reliability
of the robot. Structural integrity and impact resistance is a direct consequence of the
chassis material tensile strength. Additionally, the load-bearing capacity - with the weight
of components and payloads - is affected by the toughness of the material. Tensile
Strength is measured by MPa.

Rank
The rank in a House of Quality matrix is a way to organize engineering specifications to be
focussed on, based on their importance in meeting customer requirements. Importance ratings are
assigned by associating the customer requirement importance with the intersecting weight
relating customer requirements with engineering specifications. The importance rating is
calculated for each engineering specification, and then the total for all specifications is
calculated. The percentage of each specification is computed, and ranks are allocated according
to descending percentages.

20

As can be seen from the House of Quality Matrix (In appendix), Ultrasonic/IR Sensor Accuracy
is given the highest importance, Payload Weight is given second, Motor torque and Robot
Dimensions are tied third, Servo Tilt is at fourth place, Motor Speed Control is fifth, Chassis
Material Tensile Strength is at sixth, Battery Capacity is at seventh, Stability on Inclines is at
eighth and Wheel Encoder Resolution is at the ninth position. This by no means indicates that
engineering specifications at lower ranks can be ignored, but rather that proper functioning of
higher rank specifications must be uncompromised to ensure successful operation.

21

Functional Decomposition
Functional decomposition is a process used to break down the overall function of a complex
system into smaller, manageable, and more specific sub-functions. For an autonomous delivery
robot, the primary function can be decomposed into several sub-functions. The primary function
of an autonomous delivery robot is to deliver packages from one location to another.
The figure in Appendix C describes the functional breakdown into a block diagram for easy
understanding. The white box characterizes the package delivery function (primary), with
energy, material, and information flowing through it. As can be seen, the input for the function is
the raw material required for the system to function. The output from the function directs the
robot peripherals to accomplish tasks within the surrounding environment. The details are listed
below:

Functional Overview
Function Inputs:
●​ Energy: Energy input from the 7V LiPo battery, is supplied to the system for component
functioning.
●​ Material: Material input would be the payload transported by the module. Additionally,
this would cover interaction with surrounding physical objects and surfaces.
●​ Information: Information input would be the raw sensor data from infrared and
ultrasonic sensors.

Function Outputs:
●​ Energy: Energy output is supplied to the servo and drive motors for movement of the
grippers and module.
●​ Material: Material output would be the delivery of the payload transported by the
module. Additionally, physical wear and tear of components can be considered under this
section.

22
●​ Information: Information output would consist of the processed control signals for
navigation and gripper control.

System Components
Voltage Regulation System - The voltage regulation system outputs a fixed voltage regardless
of input fluctuations from the battery system. It is part of the electrical flow in the system
function, sending a stable 5V power supply to the Arduino and components, and input voltage to
the drive motors.
Position Sensing - Position sensing uses ultrasonic sensors to collect proximity data related to
the robot’s position. Two ultrasonic sensors on either side of the module process this data into
distance measurements and feed the result into the control system for real-time navigation.
Payload and Obstacle Sensing - This system uses a dual IR sensor setup to detect obstacles and
the payload to be picked up. This data would be fed back to the control system - similar to the
positioning sensing system - for handling obstacles and ensuring payload collection.
Control System - The control system can be likened to a central processing unit, where the
distance measurement data from the sensors is processed. These distances are fed into the control
function to output control signals to the drive motor system and payload collect system for
navigation and payload handling, respectively.
Drive Motor System - The Drive Motor System resembles the Cytron 2A Motor Driver Module
that receives control signals from the control system and relays it to the drive motors for
movement and positioning. Additionally, the drive motor system relays the necessary energy
from the voltage regulator to the motors for functioning.
Payload Collect System - This system handles the collection and delivery of payloads. The data
released from the control system block is relayed to the servo motors through this system.
Additionally, the energy for the servo motors is also imparted through this system.

Concept Development and Screening
The next phase takes into consideration the screening of the components discussed in the
brainstorming and concept generation phase. The screening can be most accurately determined
by the use of a decision matrix.
A decision matrix is a tool used to evaluate different available options based on weighted
criteria. It is utilized to provide structured comparisons for objective decision-making. This
allows the team to clarify trade-offs and identify the best choice. Since the team will be
evaluating each of the options for specific components, the team shall blend relevant engineering
specifications from the Engineering Specifications and Benchmarking section, along with
applicable specifications for each component type in the team's project itself. The relevant
engineering specifications will be chosen based on the relationship chart built in the House of
Quality matrix. All Decision Matrices can be found in Appendix D.

Decision Matrix for Power Supply
For the team's power supply, the options of Li-Ion, LiPo, and NiMH battery cells were
brainstormed. Using a decision matrix with the criteria of Battery Lifespan, Battery Capacity,
Output Voltage, Cost, Energy Density, Consistent Motor Torque, Battery Dimensions, Safety and
Maintenance.
LiPo batteries have scored the highest, with a total score of 144, compared to 134 from Li-ion
and 121 from NiMH batteries. LiPo batteries are made with flexible polymer electrolytes.
Therefore, while the energy density of Li-ion batteries is typically higher in terms of volume,
LiPo batteries excel in compact applications where their flat, flexible form can be packed more
efficiently, making the most out of the available space. LiPo batteries are generally lighter than
Li-ion and NiMH batteries in these cases. LiPo batteries can deliver higher discharge rates (burst
power), ideal for instant power demands without degrading. They are less likely to overheat
under load compared to Li-ion and NiMH. More importantly, LiPo batteries give consistent
voltage for regulated motor torque output. These favorable characteristics directed the team to
choose LiPo batteries for the project.

24

Decision Matrix for Motors
For the team's motor choice, 5 ideas were brainstormed: Geared DC Motor, Continuous Rotation
Servo Motor, Stepper Motor, Brushless DC Motor, and Brushed DC Motor. The criteria used for
the decision matrix are required input voltage, cost, efficiency, motor torque, motor speed
control, motor dimensions, robot stability on inclines, and durability.
As can be seen, the Geared DC Motor has the highest total value of 132, compared to the
Continuous Rotation Servo Motor with a value of 130, the Brushless DC Motor scored 126, the
Stepper Motor scored 115 and the Brushed DC Motor scored 113. Geared DC Motors have high
torque at low speeds, allowing them to carry heavy payload weights and uneven terrain.
Additionally, Geared DC Motors are compact for their relatively high power output. Finally, they
require a lower input voltage, efficiency, and durability.

Decision Matrix for Sensors
For the team’s sensing mechanism, 5 ideas were brainstormed: Ultrasonic Sensor, IR Sensor,
LIDAR Sensor, Proximity Sensor, and Wheel Encoders. The criteria used for the decision matrix
are Accuracy, Range, Environmental Adaptability, Cost, Power Consumption, Reliability, Ease
of Integration, and Sensor Dimension.
As can be seen, the IR sensor (Sharp) has the highest total value of 128, compared to Ultrasonic
Sensors with a value of 127, LIDAR Sensors with a value of 122, Wheel Encoders with a score
of 120, and Proximity Sensors with a value of 96. IR Sensors are championed for their small size
and low cost, making them favorable for small, low-cost delivery robots. Additionally, they are
reliable, easy to integrate, and have a good range. They can also adapt to a variety of
environments. While LIDAR Sensors were also initially ideated as an alternative, their low score
on sensor dimensions, high cost, and power consumption made this option less lucrative.
Ultrasonic Sensors are screened to be a good option for calculating distance for their higher
accuracy as compared to IR Sensors. With this screening process, the team deliberated on using
IR Sensors for front object and wall detection, while using Ultrasonic Sensors for wall following
on the robot’s sides.

25

Decision Matrix for Drive Mechanisms
For the robot’s drive mechanism, 3 ideas were brainstormed: Wheels, Propellers, and a Chain
Drive System. The criteria used for the decision matrix are Terrain Adaptability, Efficiency,
Payload Capacity, Stability, Maneuverability, Cost, Ease of Implementation, and Durability.
As can be seen, the Wheels have the highest total value of 151, compared to Chain Drives with a
value of 142 and Propellers with a value of 107. Wheels are tendered for their low cost, ease of
implementation, and efficiency. Wheels, however, are lower rated for their terrain adaptability
and payload weight, whereas Chain Drives are graded highly. Chain Drives are poor in efficiency
and Dimensions, but are durable in operation and stable on inclines. Propellers are low-rated for
their poor terrain adaptability, instability, and difficulty in implementation, which made them less
favorable for the project.

Decision Matrix for Payload Collection and Delivery Mechanism
For the payload pickup and delivery mechanism, 2 ideas were brainstormed: Grippers and
Shovel Mechanism. The criteria used for the decision matrix are Stability of Payload, Precision,
Ease of Use, Cost, Payload Weight, Durability, Material Strength, Payload Versatility, and
Dimensions.
As can be seen, the Grippers have the highest total value of 150, and the Shovels have a value of
135. Grippers are proffered for their payload stability, payload precision, payload versatility, and
ease of use. Shovels, on the other hand, are rated highly for holding high payload weights but are
not good for payload precision, versatility, and stability. Since these criteria are highly important
for this project, grippers are chosen as the team’s primary payload collection and delivery
mechanism.

Engineering Analysis
Engineering Analysis
This section presents a comprehensive engineering evaluation of the autonomous delivery robot,
emphasizing calculations that guarantee the design adheres to performance, stability, and
efficiency standards. The review encompasses load calculations, motor torque specifications,
power consumption analysis, stability evaluation, and sensor positioning to meet the functional
requirements detailed in the report.
1.​ Load and Weight Distribution Assessment
To verify that the robot can adequately support its payload and navigate inclined surfaces without
the risk of tipping, the team performs a load distribution analysis and evaluates stability.
Payload Weight Calculation:
●​ Payload Weight (W_payload): 0. 25 𝑘𝑔
●​ Gravitational Acceleration (g): 9. 81 𝑚/𝑠²
●​ Force Exerted by Payload:
𝐹_𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑 = 𝑊_𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑙𝑜𝑎𝑑 × 𝑔 = 0. 25 × 9. 81 = 2. 45 𝑁
Total Weight of Robot Components: Assuming the combined weight of the robot's
components, which include sensors, motors, and the frame, is approximately 1.5 kg:
●​ Total Force from Weight (F_total):
𝐹_𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = (1. 5 + 0. 25) × 9. 81 = 17. 14 𝑁
Center of Gravity Evaluation:
●​ The design of the robot incorporates a low center of gravity by positioning heavier
elements, such as the battery and motors, near the base. This configuration reduces the
likelihood of tipping.
Stability Assessment on Inclined Surfaces: For an incline angle (θ) of 15°:

27
𝐹_𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙 = 𝐹_𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 × 𝑠𝑖𝑛(θ) = 17. 14 × 𝑠𝑖𝑛(15°) = 4. 44 𝑁
If F_parallel surpasses the available traction force, the robot may slide. Adjustments to the
weight distribution can be made to enhance stability, or additional traction materials can be
applied to the wheels.
2.​ Motor Torque and Power Requirements
The motors of the robot must produce adequate torque to facilitate the movement of both the
robot and its payload, particularly on sloped surfaces.
Torque Necessary for Movement:
●​ Wheel Radius (r): 0.03 m
●​ Total Required Force (Ftotal): 17.14 N
●​ Required Torque (τ):
τ = 𝐹𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 × 𝑟 = 17. 14 × 0. 03 = 0. 514 𝑁𝑚
Motor Selection: The chosen N20 DC motors, each with a rated torque of 0.6 Nm, are capable
of delivering sufficient force to propel the robot and its payload.
Power Consumption Calculation: With a motor voltage of 6V and a current draw of 1.5A:
●​ Power per motor (P):
𝑃 = 𝑉 × 𝐼 = 6 × 1. 5 = 9 𝑊
Thus, with two motors, the total power requirement for movement amounts to 18 W.
3.​ Battery Capacity and Runtime
The robot's battery must supply sufficient energy to ensure a minimum operational duration of 60
minutes.

28
Battery Capacity Calculation:
●​

The total power consumption (P_total) from sensors, control boards, and motors is
estimated to be 20 W.

●​

The required runtime (T) is 1 hour (3600 seconds).

●​

Energy required:
𝐸 = 𝑃_𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 × 𝑇 = 20 × 3600 = 72000 𝐽 = 20 𝑊ℎ

For a 7.4V LiPo battery:
●​

Required capacity (C):
𝐶 = 𝐸 / 𝑉 = 20 / 7. 4 ≈ 2. 7 𝐴ℎ

A battery with a capacity of 3000mAh (3Ah) is adequate to fulfill the runtime requirement.
4.​ Sensor Range and Precision
In the context of obstacle detection and navigation:
Ultrasonic Sensor Range: 2–400 cm with an accuracy of ±1 cm
IR Sensor Range: 10–80 cm with an accuracy of ±0.5 cm
These sensors are suitable for identifying obstacles within the maze, as the ultrasonic sensor
offers extended-range detection while the IR sensor facilitates precise measurements at close
distances.
5.​ Mechanical Strength Evaluation
Chassis Material Stress Assessment: Materials: PLA and PETG
●​

Tensile Strength of PLA: 60 MPa

●​

Tensile Strength of PETG: 50 MPa

Maximum Load on Chassis: Applying a conservative safety factor of 2:
𝐴𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠 = 𝑇𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑙𝑒 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ / 𝐹𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑎𝑓𝑒𝑡𝑦 = 60 / 2 = 30 𝑀𝑃𝑎

29
The anticipated maximum stress on the chassis remains significantly below this threshold,
demonstrating adequate material strength for resilience under standard operational loads.
6.​ Analysis of Grip and Traction
Condition of Wheel Slip: To prevent slipping on slopes:
●​

The coefficient of friction (μ) for rubber on smooth surfaces is roughly 0.7.

●​

The necessary traction force (F_traction) is calculated as follows:
𝐹_𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝐹_𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 × μ = 17. 14 × 0. 7 = 12 𝑁

Given that F_traction surpasses F_parallel, the wheels are capable of delivering sufficient
traction.

Form Design
Chassis and Gripper: The team chose the horizontal chassis for the lower center of gravity and
ease of modifications, with additional levels added to support electronics and sensors over the
three phases of the project. Moreover, a Gripper Assembly was created to meet the requirements
of the package the team has to handle.

and navigation, thereby minimizing the likelihood of collisions. The control system
analyzes sensor information to dynamically modify the robot's trajectory, effectively
averting accidents in restricted environments.

2.​ Payload Security:
●​

The gripper mechanism is designed to firmly hold payloads during movement, thereby
mitigating the risk of unintentional drops. Additionally, the servo-controlled tilt
mechanism enhances payload stability, ensuring secure transport across uneven surfaces.

points and standardized connections enable the integration of new sensors, battery
upgrades, or even custom gripper attachments.

●​

This design flexibility allows the robot to adapt to new tasks or environments, thereby
increasing its applicability across various domains.

43

Test Plan, Test Results, and Product Validation
Low-Level Tests
●​

Motor Load, Power, and Rotation: The motor’s efficiency was assessed by measuring
the load it could sustain while maintaining consistent power output and rotation speed.
The motor showed adequate performance on moderate loads, but as the load increased,
power consumption rose, indicating a need for stronger support or better power
management for heavier tasks.

●​

Speed Analysis on Each Chain: The speed consistency across the chains was tested to
ensure smooth motion. Observations showed slight discrepancies in speed, potentially
due to variances in chain length or tension.

●​

Gear Cog Size Issue: During testing, it became apparent that the initial gear cog size was
insufficient for effective transmission. Larger gears were implemented, requiring chain
link adjustments. This change allowed for better force distribution and smoother motion.

44
●​

Sensor Testing: Sensor testing for mobile robots is a critical process to ensure that the
robot can accurately perceive its environment, navigate, and interact with objects. Results
showed that the two front IR sensors and side Ultrasonic sensors were accurate. All
sensors were able to detect objects in front of them with sufficient precision to ensure
stable operation.

Medium Level Tests
●​

Gripper Assembly Precision: Precise control of the servo motor was essential for
accurate position alignment and was tested by manipulating the drive chain. Results
showed that proper alignment was maintained under various loads, confirming the servo’s
reliability in keeping the chain in its correct position.

●​

Navigational Accuracy: To test the accuracy of navigation for the robot, the team tested
the sensors mounted on the chassis with the code mentioned in the appendix. The sensors
were able to detect objects in the robot’s path, thereby instructing the drive motors to
redirect the robot by turning left or right based on the side ultrasonic sensor readings.
This indicated the successful navigation of the robot.

●​

Terrain Efficiency: The robot was tested on different surfaces, including grass, wood,
pebbles, and mirrors It performed well on less coarse terrains like grass and wood.
However, traction was significantly compromised on pebbles and mirrors, where the
drive chain struggled. These results indicated a need for improved traction capabilities to
handle more demanding surfaces confidently.

45
●​ Electronics and Software Efficiency: Faulty and loose connections were identified
during the testing process, resulting in uneven motor performance. After securing
soldered wire connections and enclosing them for protection using heat shrinks,
consistency improved. Despite these efforts, one motor continued to underperform,
increasing the battery load. One battery exhibited bulging, necessitating a replacement to
prevent safety hazards. These issues were further resolved for Phase B by implementing
the prototype shield, connecting common Vcc and GND connections, and reducing the
number of connections.

High-Level Tests
●​

Robot Operational Results:

●​

Ramp Descent Testing:
○​ Objective: Assess the control logic's capability to facilitate a smooth descent of
the robot down the ramp, while modulating speed and direction in response to
sensor input.
○​ Method: The robot utilized ultrasonic sensors to measure distances and identify
obstacles along the descent route. Upon detecting an obstacle in proximity, the
control logic decreased the motor speed and modified the trajectory to prevent
collisions.
○​ Outcome: The robot demonstrated the ability to dynamically adjust its descent,
validating that the control logic effectively governed speed and obstacle
avoidance in real time.

●​

Maze Navigation Testing:
○​ Objective: Analyze the control logic's performance in navigating confined spaces
and executing complex turns through wall-following and path-finding techniques.
○​ Method: Infrared sensors were employed to identify walls and narrow passages,
allowing the robot to adopt a wall-following navigation strategy within the maze.
The control algorithm also monitored turn sequences and distances to facilitate
path retracing when necessary.

○​ Outcome: The control logic of the robot successfully navigated the maze with
precision, adapting its route based on sensor feedback. Nonetheless, opportunities
for optimization in path retracing were recognized as a potential enhancement for
improved exit efficiency.

Results During Demo
The robot started successfully but encountered issues with executing the wall-following logic,
which resulted in the robot having trouble in keeping itself centered within the ramp itself. The
robot was able to enter the maze upon reaching the bottom of the ramp, but there were issues
with navigating the maze itself. During both attempts of Phase B, the robot was able to enter the
maze by using minimal save moves, but continuing toward the maze cell which contained the
package seemed to prove difficult. The results indicated that while the team’s components were
operating perfectly, some adjustments in the code were needed to ensure success for the next
phase.

47

Modifications for the Next Phase
●​

Re-configure Chain Drive System: The team will optimize the chain drive system to
improve performance and increase efficiency. The plan is to layer wheels with chain links
to ensure proper tension and reduce motor load. Adding the chain links will also give
improved traction on the number of terrains to be faced in Phase C.

●​

Introduce Control System to Enhance Module Localization: The team will aim to
implement a control system that enables precise localization of the module, by
establishing a feedback loop and improving the sensor integration. The plan is to also
execute interrupts for the front IR sensors, which will enhance the localization process.

●​

Voltage Regulation: Efforts will be focused on ensuring a stable and consistent voltage
supply to protect sensitive components and enhance the reliability of the system.

Conclusions
The autonomous delivery robot initiative has achieved notable progress in fulfilling the goals set
for both Phases A and B, showcasing a successful amalgamation of mechanical, electrical, and
control systems into a cohesive mechatronic structure. During Phase A, the robot adeptly
navigated various terrains, including grass, pebbles, and mulch, while autonomously delivering
packages within a controlled setting. This accomplishment underscored the effective
collaboration among essential components, such as the Arduino Due, Cytron L298P motor
driver, and N20 motors, which ensured dependable control over movement, speed, and direction.
The incorporation of encoders provides accurate feedback, significantly improving the robot's
capability to adhere to predefined paths.
In Phase B, these functionalities were further enhanced, with an emphasis on navigating intricate
environments, such as descending ramps and maneuvering through mazes. Although the robot
successfully entered the maze, it faced difficulties in retrieving the package and exiting the maze.
Nevertheless, the advancements made highlight the design's operational effectiveness and the
potential for further enhancements. The IR and ultrasonic sensors were instrumental, offering
real-time obstacle detection that facilitated safe navigation through the maze. The chain-driven
drive system, modular chassis design, and secure servo motor mounts collectively enhanced the
robot's stability and adaptability, enabling controlled movement in restricted areas.
The project has emphasized modularity, ease of maintenance, and efficient power management,
allowing the robot to maintain equilibrium, comply with physical limitations, and function within
a specified environment. The servo motors designed for package manipulation effectively
controlled the base tilt and gripper mechanisms, ensuring secure handling of packages—a vital
aspect of the robot's capability to autonomously complete delivery tasks.
As the project advances, enhancements including sophisticated sensor integration, optimized
navigation algorithms, and enhanced terrain adaptability will significantly augment the robot's
capabilities. The modular design permits easy upgrades, promoting scalability and flexibility for
undertaking more complex tasks in subsequent phases.

49
In conclusion, Phases A and B of the project have effectively established a strong foundation for
autonomous package delivery, achieving immediate goals while creating a solid platform for
ongoing development. The progress made in precise motor control, dependable package
handling, and autonomous navigation has positioned the robot as a viable solution for indoor
logistics automation, providing valuable contributions to the domains of mechatronics and
autonomous systems.
